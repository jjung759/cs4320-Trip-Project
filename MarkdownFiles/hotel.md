There will be three rooms:
- Hayden, Jim in room 1

The total cost for lodging for the first night:

#### Room

As there are six of us, we have chosen to stay in **3 separate 2-Bedroom Penthouse Suite** rooms, where we can enjoy 3 separate living rooms that look like this:

The room assignments are the same as above.

As there are 3 rooms, we multiply the reservation total by 3.

$2,334.38 * 3 = $7,003.14

This accounts for tax and the "Resort Fee" that we must pay.

#### Check in / out Details

In the fine print below the reservation total, the check in and out times are discussed (No images, that was really tiny)
- Check in time is 3:00 PM
- Check out time is 11:00 AM
