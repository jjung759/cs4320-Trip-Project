* Intuitively, St-Louis should be a better start-point of a long-distance trip

* We will get to St. Louis by taking an uberXL for $299 there and $349 back, which will take approximately 2 hours

2. Local Transportation
	* Las Vegas Monorail (optional)
		* Cause the railway is always via the most gorgeous scenery of the city , we can try it for sightseeing    
		* [Monorail](https://www.lvmonorail.com/#)
	* Car Rental  
		* [Car Rental Detail](https://github.com/jjung759/cs4320-Trip-Project/blob/feature/rentalVehicles/rentalCar.md)
3. Total cost
		* Fixed cost:   4056 + 299 + 349 =$ 4704
		* potential cost : rental fee (undefined)
