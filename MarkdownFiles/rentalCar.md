* Parking would cost $54 roughly for all three days provided that we self park.

* Total Car cost for the trip would be $278.21

# Uber

* Our second option would be to use ride share apps such as Uber. We would have to purchase UberXL for all rides as a result of how many of us there are.
* Once on the Las Vegas Strip we would be able to walk to most of our entertainment options
