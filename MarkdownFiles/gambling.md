##### Gambling

[According to Jay Bean,](http://meredith.worldnow.com/story/22172946/dont-waste-your-money-best-and-worst-casino-game-odds) the floor manager at a casino, the place to gamble at is NOT the slot machines.

The article states that the games with the highest odds are as follows:

1. Blackjack
2. Craps
3. Roulette

We want to maximize our potential earnings, so **we will put forth most of our money on Blackjack.** With Blackjack, we would be playing against the dealer, as opposed to against other people, and according to the article the house has an edge of about 1% at most casinos.

To start with, we plan on spending **$10,000** at the Bellagio Casino, dividing it up among us once we arrive (though most will be spent on Blackjack.) As none of us have gambling addictions or want to have gambling addictions, we will play until we are out or we have made a significant return and feel it would be safer to keep our earnings.

It would be optimal to get practice in during our free time on the night of February 22nd. This would ensure that when us + Trevor access the casino later on during our trip, we have a better understanding of the game and can hopefully win.
