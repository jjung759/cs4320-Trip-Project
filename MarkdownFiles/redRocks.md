### On Friday the 23rd we need to kill time before we can check into the Bellagio, the Red Rocks National Canyon area is about 30 minutes away from our hotel.
### We can take an uber from the strip to the park for about $72 each way.
### Fare entrance is $5 per person, so $30 total.
### Once we're there, we can hike the Moenkopi loop, which takes about an hour and a half, and is about 2 miles long. See image:
