The room assignments are as follows:
- Hayden and Jim in room 1
- Caleb and He in room 2
- Trevor and Tristin in room 3

#### Price

The price for one room for the weekend of February 23rd - 25th is below.

As there are 3 rooms, we multiply the reservation total by 3.

$2,334.38 * 3 = $7,003.14

This accounts for tax and the "Resort Fee" that we must pay.

#### Check in / out Details

- Check in time is 3:00 PM
